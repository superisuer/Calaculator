# Calaculator
ðŸ˜° Calaculator â€” a calculator with absurd arithmetic and handmade operations.

## Features

- **Absurd Arithmetic:** All calculations are done manually using loops â€” addition, subtraction, multiplication, and even division. Why use standard math when you can subtract in style?
- **Division by Zero Allowed:** Because why not? Enter zero as the divisor and watch chaos unfold. Totally intentional, totally absurd.
- **Subtraction-based Division:** Dividing numbers by repeatedly subtracting the divisor. Totally unnecessary, totally fun.  
- **Iterative Multiplication:** Multiplication is done through repeated addition. Old-school, quirky, and hilarious.  
- **Vibrations Feedback:** Short vibrations on normal input, long vibrations on mistakes. Feel every key press.  
- **Realtime Calculation Display:** Option to see intermediate results as the loops compute the answer. Watch the chaos happen live!  
- **Handcrafted Numbers:** Manual arithmetic gives full control over every step of the calculation.
